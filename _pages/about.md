I am a Junior undergraduate student at [Department of Information Science & Electronic Engineering](http://www.isee.zju.edu.cn/main.htm), [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/), China.

Currently, I am working with [Prof. Cheng Zhuo](https://person.zju.edu.cn/chengzhuo) researching on hardware acceleration algorithm based on reinforcement learning for deep learning. Previously, I focused on research on efficient convolutional neural network search method for medical image segmentation with [Prof.  Cheng Zhuo](https://person.zju.edu.cn/chengzhuo). I also collaborated with [Prof. Chunguang Li](https://person.zju.edu.cn/cgli) to develop hash learning algorithm based on deep neural network and applied it in efficient image retrieval.



## Research Interests

My research interests are in machine learning with applications for healthcare. I am also interested in computer vision related topics.
