I am a Junior undergraduate student at [Department of Information Science & Electronic Engineering](http://www.isee.zju.edu.cn/main.htm), [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/), China.

Currently, I am working with [Prof. Samuel Madden](http://db.csail.mit.edu/madden/) to develop a Spark-based anomaly detection and interpretation system. Previously, I focused on research on efficient convolutional neural network search method for medical image segmentation with [Prof.  Cheng Zhuo](https://person.zju.edu.cn/chengzhuo). I also collaborated with [Prof. Chunguang Li](https://person.zju.edu.cn/cgli) to develop hash learning algorithm based on deep neural network and applied it in efficient image retrieval.



## Research Interests

Data mining and optimization of machine learning interest me a lot. I am also intersted in biomedical analytics and health informatics.
